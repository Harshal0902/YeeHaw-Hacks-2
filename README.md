We are also using **Appwrite's Storage** to store the images of the markers. We are using **Appwrite's Functions** to send the notification to Animal Rescue. We are using **Appwrite's OAuth** to authenticate the users. We are using **Appwrite's Console** to manage the database and the storage. We are using **Appwrite's CLI** to deploy the functions.
