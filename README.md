## ⚙️ How we built it

## ☁️ Best Use of Appwrite

We are using Appwrite for building our backend. We are using **Appwrite's Database** to store the data of the users and their progress. We are also using **Appwrite's Storage** to store the images of the markers. We are using **Appwrite's Functions** to send the notification to Animal Rescue. We are using **Appwrite's OAuth** to authenticate the users. We are using **Appwrite's Console** to manage the database and the storage. We are using **Appwrite's CLI** to deploy the functions. Appwrite made it very easy for us to build our backend. We learned how robust & fast Appwrite services are as it has a free plan that was great for us student hackers.
